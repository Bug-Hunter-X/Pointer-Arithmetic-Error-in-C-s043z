# Pointer Arithmetic Error in C
This repository demonstrates a simple C program that illustrates a potential error when working with pointers. The program intends to modify a variable's value using a pointer. However, it lacks error handling and could lead to unexpected behavior in more complex scenarios.

## Bug Description
The original code directly modifies the value pointed to by 'ptr' without sufficient checks.

## Solution
The solution addresses this by introducing checks to prevent potential errors.
